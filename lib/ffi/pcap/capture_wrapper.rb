    # A superclass for both offline and live interfaces, but not dead
    # interfaces. This class provides all the features necessary for
    # receiving packets through libpcap.
    #
    # The loop and dispatch methods default to using a {CopyHandler} object
    # when preparing values to the callback block. This is done to safely 
    # provide references to packets outside of the callback blocks.  
    # See CopyHandler for more information. 
    #
    # Note that for performance reasons, you may not need or want to incur 
    # the extra overhead of creating a copy for every Packet. You can supply
    # a `nil` value for the loop handler which will simply pass volatile 
    # references to packets directly to your block. You can also write
    # custom handlers which implement the `receive_pcap` method and
    # implement custom defined behaviors.

      #
      # Setting :handler to `nil` will pass packets directly to a block
      # without copying them, which may be desirable if the packets are
      # only ever processed within the block, and code does not need to
      # retain a reference to them elsewhere.
